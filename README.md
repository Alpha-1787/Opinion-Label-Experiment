# Opinion-Label-Experiment

The purpose of our experiment was to see if labeling articles written like factual news articles
would impact its persuasiveness. Our goal in doing this was to see if this could be part of a
solution with combatting disinformation. To do this, our group picked a neutral article and had
participants in our experiment a version of this article. For the control group, the article was
unlabeled while for the treatment group, the article was labeled as an opinion piece. We then
measured the persuasiveness of the article by asking both groups in a survey to rate the articles
on the dimensions of factualness, effectiveness and how likely they were to recommend it.
While a significant treatment effect was detected on the effectiveness dimension, there were no
significant treatment effects detected on the other dimensions. Nonetheless, there remain areas
that would be interesting to come back to.
